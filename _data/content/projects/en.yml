        # Pemberitahuan 01

        This is an example page to display markdown related styles for Mr. Green Jekyll Theme.

        **William Shakespeare**, Let me not to the marriage of true minds
        Admit impediments. Love is not love
        Which alters when it alteration finds,
        Or bends with the remover to remove.
        O no, it is an ever-fixed mark
        That looks on tempests and is never shaken;
        It is the star to every wand'ring barque,
        Whose worth's unknown, although his height be taken.
        Love's not Time's fool, though rosy lips and cheeks
        Within his bending sickle's compass come;
        Love alters not with his brief hours and weeks,
        But bears it out even to the edge of doom.
        If this be error and upon me proved,
        I never writ, nor no man ever loved.
